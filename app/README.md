# A Boy and His Box Backend

This is a bit of a Websocket/Game/Physics experiment for me. This is the
backend WebSocket server for a game that's in space and lives in a 2D top-down
environment. Possibly multiplayer, I dunno yet.

## Development/Setup
Utilize Docker Compose, and then:

```
	docker-compose up
```

## TO DO
- Authentication
